        <br>
        <h3> With the look and feel of a 1950's service garage with a new-school twist, High Octane Coffee Company combines the automotive culture with in-house roasted coffee, local ice cream, and provides a fun, up-beat place to hang out with your friends. Our friendly and knowledgeable barista staff is always happy to serve you and help you choose the perfect beverage to shift your taste buds into high gear!</h3>
        <br>
        <h3> We serve many signature handcrafted blends with creative names reflecting our gear head lifestyle and humble Ohio Rust Belt roots.  All of our roasts are available straight up or you may choose from our full espresso bar menu. For those craving the taste but need something cool for those hot afternoons, all of our drinks are available iced as well. Then, for those craving that extreme dose of caffeine on ice, there's our HIGH OCTANE Cold Brew.</h3>
        <br>
        <h3> High Octane also features a wide selection of pre-packaged baked goods, ice cream, old fashion milkshakes, breakfast sandwiches and wraps. A selection of appropriately designed merchandise completes the experience.</h3>
        <br>
        <h3>We invite you to join us for a coffee experience unlike no other, one that will bring you back to our “Shop” for frequent voluntary tune-ups!</h3>
